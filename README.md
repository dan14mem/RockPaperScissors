# RockPaperScissors
A basic text based game to practice Javascript. Potentially will be expanded upon in the future to create a front end.

notes:

I added the last function before going to bed. I am yet to figure out what 'returning' is, but i need to do that instead of console logging; that is the step tomorrow.

so far I am up to step 4 on the Odin Project. Maybe i should edit the text to be a full sentance.
